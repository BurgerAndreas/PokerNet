# PokerNet

Beginning of an AI poker player. <br>
For now, it's just a poker game. <br>
You can play against five very simple bots, or let the bots play against themselves. <br>

### Conda

```
conda create -n poker python=3.10.9
conda activate poker
conda install numpy

conda install pip
pip install phevaluator
```

### Future improvements

- vectorization math instead of loops
